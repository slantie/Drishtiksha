# Drishtiksha AI - Backend Service v2.0 ‚úÖ

## üìú Overview

This repository contains the backend service for the Drishtiksha AI Deepfake Detection System. It is a robust **Node.js/Express** application designed to serve as the central orchestrator for user authentication, video management, and the coordination of analysis tasks with a powerful Python-based AI microservice.

This v2.0 has been completely refactored to an **asynchronous, queue-based architecture**. When a user uploads a video, the job is immediately queued for background processing, providing a responsive user experience and a highly scalable foundation. The backend then communicates with the Python ML service to perform a comprehensive, multi-model analysis, persisting all results to a **PostgreSQL** database using the **Prisma ORM**.

### üéØ **Integration Status: FULLY OPERATIONAL**

## ‚ú® Key Features

### üöÄ **Production-Ready Integration**

-   **Asynchronous Analysis Workflow:** Videos are uploaded and immediately queued for background processing, providing instant feedback to the user.
-   **Dynamic Multi-Model Analysis:** The service automatically queries the Python API to find all available models and runs every supported analysis type (`QUICK`, `DETAILED`, `FRAMES`, `VISUALIZE`) for each one.
-   **Proven Reliability:** Successfully processes multiple concurrent analyses with 8+ completed analyses per video in testing.

### üîí **Security & Authentication**

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

The Prisma schema is designed to capture all facets of the analysis process.

-   **`User`**: Stores user credentials and profile information.
-   **`Video`**: Tracks each uploaded video, its Cloudinary URL, and its current processing status (`QUEUED`, `PROCESSING`, `ANALYZED`, `FAILED`).
-   **`DeepfakeAnalysis`**: The central table linking a `Video` to a specific analysis result from a particular `model` and `analysisType`.
-   **Related Analysis Tables**: `AnalysisDetails`, `FrameAnalysis`, and `AnalysisError` store the rich, normalized data returned by the Python API.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

-   Node.js 18+
-   PostgreSQL 12+
-   A running instance of the Python Deepfake Detection Service.
-   A Cloudinary account.

### Quick Start

1.  **Navigate to Backend Directory**
    ```bash
    cd Backend
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Setup Environment Variables**
    Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in your configuration details (database URL, JWT secrets, Cloudinary credentials, and the Python server URL/API key).
    ```env
    # .env
    DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/drishtiksha_db"
    JWT_SECRET="your-jwt-secret"
    CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
    CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"
    SERVER_URL="http://localhost:8000"
    SERVER_API_KEY="your-python-server-api-key"
    ...
    ```
4.  **Initialize Database**
    Generate the Prisma client and push the schema to your database.
    ```bash
    npx prisma generate
    npx prisma db push
    ```
5.  **Start the Server**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

The server will start on the port defined in your `.env` file (default: 3000).

## üìñ API Documentation

The API is versioned under `/api/v1`. All video routes require a Bearer token for authentication.

### Authentication

-   `POST /api/v1/auth/register`: Create a new user account.
-   `POST /api/v1/auth/login`: Log in to receive an `accessToken` and `refreshToken`.

### Main Workflow

The new workflow is fully asynchronous and much simpler for the client.

**Step 1: Upload a Video**
The client makes a single request to upload a video. The server immediately accepts it and queues it for background processing.

-   `POST /api/v1/videos`
    -   **Content-Type:** `multipart/form-data`
    -   **Body:**
        -   `video`: The video file.
        -   `description`: (Optional) A description for the video.
    -   **Response:** `202 Accepted` with the initial video record, which will have a status of `QUEUED`.

**Step 2: Check for Results**
The client can poll this endpoint to get the latest status and the full analysis results once they are complete. The `status` field will change from `QUEUED` -\> `PROCESSING` -\> `ANALYZED`.

-   `GET /api/v1/videos/:id`
    -   **Response:** The complete video object, including a populated `analyses` array with detailed results from all models.

### Other Endpoints

-   `GET /api/v1/videos`: Get a list of all videos for the authenticated user.
-   `DELETE /api/v1/videos/:id`: Delete a video and all its associated data.
-   `GET /api/v1/videos/status`: Check the health and status of the downstream Python ML service.
