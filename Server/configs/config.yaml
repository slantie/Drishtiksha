# ===================================================================
# Drishtiksha AI - Main Application Configuration
# ===================================================================
# This file defines the core settings for the inference server.
# It is loaded and validated by `src/config.py` at startup.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------

# --- GLOBAL SETTINGS ---
# These values apply to the entire application unless overridden locally.
# The device setting here is overridden by the DEVICE environment variable.

project_name: "Drishtiksha: Deepfake Detection"
device: "cuda"  # Default fallback, overridden by DEVICE environment variable


# --- MODEL CONFIGURATIONS ---
# Each key here represents a unique model identifier used in API calls.
# The structure of each model's settings MUST match the corresponding Pydantic
# model defined in `src/config.py` for validation to succeed.
